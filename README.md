# Logogram Helper

Very rough dalamud plugin for Eureka's Logos Actions.

Shows combinations for Logos Actions and the amounts you're able to synthesize using your available logograms.

Based on [this tracker](https://ffxiv-eureka.com/logograms).

## How to Use
A window with all the Logos Actions should automatically pop up whenever you enter the Logos Manipulator.

Click on one of the actions to show detailed information and the combinations.

## Installation

To install the plugin from the official Dalamud repo, enable `Get plugin testing builds` under the `Experimental` tab in Dalamud Settings.

Once added, look for Logogram Helper in the Plugin Installer.

## Special Thanks
* Wrex - For the plugin icon
